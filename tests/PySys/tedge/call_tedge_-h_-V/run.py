Validate command line option -h -V

Given a running system
When we call tedge -h -V
Then we find the version string as well in the output
Then we find the string USAGE: in the output

Note: This is a candidate for deletion or transference to Rust.
In the past, there was a async issue with -h and -V this is why we created
some tests that do very similar things. They are probably not needed anymore.
