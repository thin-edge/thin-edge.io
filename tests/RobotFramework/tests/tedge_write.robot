...                 This suite aims to check the correctness of tedge-write component which is used for privilege
...                 elevation to allow tedge processes running under `tedge` user to write to configuration files
...                 on the system tedge normally doesn't have permissions for.
...
...                 tedge-write must:
...                 - write to files `tedge` have no permissions to (privilege elevation happens)
...                 - preserve permissions for existing files and apply new permissions for files created
...                 - handle permissions correctly on non-standard umasks
...                 - not leave temporary files
...
...                 Tests for tedge-write need to be done in RobotFramework because we need to run as a `tedge`
...                 user, and a sudoers entry that allows `tedge` to run `sudo tedge-write` without password
...                 needs to be present. Additionally, we need to ensure `tedge-write` works well on system where
...                 the default umask is different.
...
...                 Additionally, apart from the component itself, we need to test features that use it directly,
...                 like config_update.
