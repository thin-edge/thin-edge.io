*** Test Cases ***
Stop tedge-mapper
    Execute Command    sudo systemctl stop tedge-mapper-c8y.service

Update the service file
    Execute Command    cmd=sudo sed -i '10iWatchdogSec=30' /lib/systemd/system/tedge-mapper-c8y.service

Reload systemd files
    Execute Command    sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Start tedge-mapper
    Execute Command    sudo systemctl start tedge-mapper-c8y.service

Start watchdog service
    Execute Command    sudo systemctl start tedge-watchdog.service

    Sleep    10s

Check PID of tedge-mapper
    ${pid}=    Service Should Be Running    tedge-mapper-c8y
    Set Suite Variable    ${pid}

Kill the PID
    Kill Process    ${pid}

Recheck PID of tedge-mapper
    ${pid1}=    Service Should Be Running    tedge-mapper-c8y
    Set Suite Variable    ${pid1}

Compare PID change
    Should Not Be Equal    ${pid}    ${pid1}

Stop watchdog service
    Execute Command    sudo systemctl stop tedge-watchdog.service

Remove entry from service file
    Execute Command    sudo sed -i '10d' /lib/systemd/system/tedge-mapper-c8y.service

Watchdog does not kill mapper if it responds
    # Set the watchdog interval low so we don't have to wait long
    Execute Command    sudo systemctl stop tedge-mapper-c8y.service
