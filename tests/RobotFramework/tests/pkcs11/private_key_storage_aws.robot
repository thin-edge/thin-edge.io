Documentation       Test thin-edge.io MQTT client authentication using a Hardware Security Module (HSM).
...
...                 To do this, we install SoftHSM2 which allows us to create software-backed PKCS#11 (cryptoki)
...                 cryptographic tokens that will be read by thin-edge. In real production environments a dedicated
...                 hardware device would be used.

*** Test Cases ***
Connect to AWS Using PKCS11 Private Key
    Execute Command    sudo tedge reconnect aws    retries=0
    ThinEdgeIO.Service Health Status Should Be Up    tedge-mapper-aws
    ThinEdgeIO.Bridge Should Be Up    aws

Connect to AWS and Cumulocity using different keys
    [Documentation]    Verify that we can have two different connections open at the same time to different clouds using
    ...    different tokens/private keys because it's not very secure to use the same keys for different clouds.
