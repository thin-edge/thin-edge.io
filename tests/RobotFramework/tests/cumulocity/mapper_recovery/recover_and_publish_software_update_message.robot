*** Test Cases ***
Mapper recovers and processes output of ongoing software update request
    [Documentation]    C8y-Mapper receives a software update request,
    ...    Delegates operation to tedge-agent and gets back `executing` status
    ...    And then goes down (here purposefully stopped).
    ...    Mean while the agent processes the update message and publishes the software update message
    ...    After some time mapper recovers and pushes the result to c8y cloud
    ...    Verify that the rolldice package is installed or not
    ${timestamp}=    Get Unix Timestamp
    ThinEdgeIO.Service Should Be Running    tedge-mapper-c8y
    ${OPERATION}=    Install Software    rolldice,1.0.0::dummy
    Should Have MQTT Messages
    ...    te/device/main///cmd/software_update/+
    ...    message_contains=executing
    ...    date_from=${timestamp}
    ThinEdgeIO.Stop Service    tedge-mapper-c8y
    Should Have MQTT Messages
