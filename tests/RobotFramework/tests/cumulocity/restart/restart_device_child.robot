*** Test Cases ***
Support restarting the device
    Set Restart Command    ["/usr/bin/on_shutdown.sh", "1"]
    Set Restart Timeout    default
    Cumulocity.Should Contain Supported Operations    c8y_Restart
    ${operation}=    Cumulocity.Restart Device
    Operation Should Be SUCCESSFUL    ${operation}    timeout=180

Restart operation should be set to failed when an non-existent command is configured
    Set Restart Command    ["/usr/bin/on_shutdown_does_not_exist.sh"]
    Set Restart Timeout    60
    ${operation}=    Cumulocity.Restart Device
    Operation Should Be FAILED    ${operation}    failure_reason=Restart Failed: Fail to trigger a restart.*    timeout=30

Restart operation should be set to failed when command is not allowed by sudo
    Set Restart Command    ["/sbin/reboot"]
    Set Restart Timeout    60
    ${operation}=    Cumulocity.Restart Device
    Operation Should Be FAILED    ${operation}    failure_reason=Restart Failed: Fail to trigger a restart.*    timeout=30

Restart operation should be set to failed when the command does not restart the device
    Set Restart Command    ["/usr/bin/on_shutdown_no_reboot.sh"]
    Set Restart Timeout    30
    ${operation}=    Cumulocity.Restart Device
    Operation Should Be FAILED    ${operation}    failure_reason=Restart Failed: No shutdown has been triggered.*    timeout=60

Restart operation should be set to failed if the restart command times out
    [Documentation]    tedge should protect against commands which don't finish within a given time period (protect against hanging scripts)
    Set Restart Command    ["/usr/bin/on_shutdown.sh", "300"]
    Set Restart Timeout    5
    ${operation}=    Cumulocity.Restart Device
    Operation Should Be FAILED    ${operation}    failure_reason=Restart Failed: Restart command still running after 5 seconds    timeout=30

Restart operation should be set to failed when the command has been killed by a signal
    [Documentation]    If the restart command is killed, assume it did trigger a restart, and wait for the restart. Only fail the
        ...            the operation if the "wait for restart" logic does not detect a restart. This is because sometimes a shutdown
        ...            can trigger the script to be killed before it has a chance to exit successfully.
    Set Restart Command    ["/usr/bin/on_shutdown_signal_interrupt.sh"]
    Set Restart Timeout    30
    ${operation}=    Cumulocity.Restart Device
    Operation Should Be FAILED    ${operation}    failure_reason=Restart Failed: No shutdown has been triggered    timeout=60

Default restart timeout supports the default 60 second delay of the linux shutdown command
    [Documentation]    The shutdown -r command performs a device restart 60 seconds after being called. thin-edge.io should
        ...            support this setting out of the box
    Set Restart Command    ["shutdown", "-r"]
    Set Restart Timeout    default
    ${operation}=    Cumulocity.Restart Device
    Operation Should Be SUCCESSFUL    ${operation}    timeout=180
