Define Child device 1 ID
    Set Suite Variable    $CHILD_SN    child01
    Set Suite Variable    $CHILD_XID    ${DEVICE_SN}:device:${CHILD_SN}

Normal case when the child device does not exist on c8y cloud
    # Sending child alarm
    Execute Command
    ...    sudo tedge mqtt pub 'te/device/${CHILD_SN}///a/temperature_high' '{ "severity": "critical", "text": "Temperature is very high", "time": "2021-01-01T05:30:45+00:00" }' -q 2 -r
    # Check Child device creation
    Set Device    ${DEVICE_SN}
    Should Be A Child Device Of Device    ${CHILD_XID}

Normal case when the child device already exists
    # Sending child alarm again
    Execute Command
    ...    sudo tedge mqtt pub 'te/device/${CHILD_SN}///a/temperature_high' '{ "severity": "critical", "text": "Temperature is very high", "time": "2021-01-02T05:30:45+00:00" }' -q 2 -r

Reconciliation when the new alarm message arrives, restart the mapper
    Execute Command    sudo systemctl stop tedge-mapper-c8y.service

Reconciliation when the alarm that is cleared
    Execute Command    sudo systemctl stop tedge-mapper-c8y.service
    Execute Command    sudo tedge mqtt pub 'te/device/${CHILD_SN}///a/temperature_high' '' -q 2 -r
    Execute Command    sudo systemctl start tedge-mapper-c8y.service
