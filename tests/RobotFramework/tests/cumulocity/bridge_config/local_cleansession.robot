# Testing against older mosquitto versions is difficult as the there is not
# an easy way to installed older versions without changing the whole operating system
# (e.g. switching to Debian buster)
#
# The tests assume there is mosquitto 2.x running or newer given that this is the
# default in Debian bullseye and newer
