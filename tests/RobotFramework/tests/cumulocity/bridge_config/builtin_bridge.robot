Connection test
    [Documentation]    Repeatedly test the cloud connection
    FOR    ${attempt}    IN RANGE    0    10    1
        ${output}=    Execute Command    tedge connect c8y --test    timeout=10
        Should Not Contain    ${output}    connection check failed
    END

Support publishing QoS 0 messages to c8y topic #2960
    [Documentation]    Verify the publishing of multiple QoS 0 message directly to the cloud connection
    ...    Note 1: Since QoS 0 aren't guaranteed to be delivered, use a non-strict assertion on the exact event count in the cloud.
    ...    During testing the test would reliably fail if the expected count is less than 10 messages.
    ...    Note 2: The bridge will automatically change the QoS from 0 when translating messages from te/# to c8y/#,
    ...    we can't use the te/# topics in the test.
    FOR    ${attempt}    IN RANGE    0    20    1
        Execute Command
        ...    tedge mqtt pub -q 0 c8y/s/us '400,test_q0,Test event with qos 0 attempt ${attempt}'
        ...    timeout=10
