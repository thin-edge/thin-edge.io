*** Test Cases ***
### Main Device ###
Heartbeat is sent
    [Documentation]    Full end-to-end test which will check the Cumulocity behaviour to sending the heartbeat signal
    ...    The tests therefore relies on the backend availability service which then sets the c8y_Availability fragment
    ...    based on the last received telemetry data.
    Device Should Have Fragment Values
    ...    c8y_RequiredAvailability.responseInterval\=1
    ...    timeout=5
    ...    wait=1
    Device Should Have Fragment Values
    ...    c8y_Availability.status\=AVAILABLE
    ...    timeout=${INTERVAL_CHANGE_TIMEOUT}
    ...    wait=${CHECK_INTERVAL}
    Stop Service    tedge-agent
    Service Health Status Should Be Down    tedge-agent
    Device Should Have Fragment Values
    ...    c8y_Availability.status\=UNAVAILABLE
    ...    timeout=${INTERVAL_CHANGE_TIMEOUT}
    ...    wait=${CHECK_INTERVAL}

    Start Service    tedge-agent
    Service Health Status Should Be Up    tedge-agent
    Device Should Have Fragment Values
    ...    c8y_Availability.status\=AVAILABLE
    ...    timeout=${INTERVAL_CHANGE_TIMEOUT}
    ...    wait=${CHECK_INTERVAL}

#
# Note about remaining test cases
# The remaining test cases do not use the platform to assert whether the availability is set or not
# as this either takes too long, and is too flakey as the performance of the backend service which sets
# the c8y_Availability fragments varies greatly (as it is designed for longer intervals, e.g. ~30/60 mins)
# Instead, the test cases check if the heartbeat signal is being sent for the given devices which does not
# rely on any additional platform checks.

Heartbeat is sent based on the custom health topic status
