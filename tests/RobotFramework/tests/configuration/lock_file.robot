Check lock file existence in default folder
    [Documentation]    When deploying thin-edge components in single-process containers, 
    ...    the lock file mechanism used by some components (e.g. tedge-agent, tedge-mapper) 
    ...    do not makes sense as the container filesystem is isolated. 
    ...    Having the lock file system just adds unnecessary dependencies on the /run/lock folder.
    File Should Exist    /run/lock/tedge-agent.lock
    File Should Exist    /run/lock/tedge-mapper c8y.lock

Check starting same service twice
    [Documentation]    This step is checking if same service can be started twice, 
    ...    expected is that this should not be the case
    Execute Command    sudo -u tedge tedge-agent    exp_exit_code=!0
    Execute Command    sudo -u tedge tedge-mapper c8y    exp_exit_code=!0

Switch off lock file creation
    [Documentation]    Add a new configuration option under the '[run]'' section to turn off the lock file generation logic. 
    ...    '[run]' 
    ...    'lock_files = false' 
    ...    Having this configuration setting allows the user to set it using a common environment 
    ...    setting when running the components in individual containers.
    #Stop the running services
    Stop Service    tedge-mapper-c8y
    Stop Service    tedge-agent
    #Remove the existing lock files
    Execute Command    sudo rm /run/lock/ted*
    Execute Command    sudo tedge config set run.lock_files false
    #Restart the stopped services
    Start Service    tedge-mapper-c8y
    Start Service    tedge-agent
    #Check that no lock file is created
    File Should Not Exist    /run/lock/tedge-agent.lock
    File Should Not Exist    /run/lock/tedge-mapper-c8y.lock
