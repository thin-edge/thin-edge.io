Check remote mqtt broker #1773
    [Documentation]    The test relies on two containers functioning as one logical device. 1 container (CONTAINER_1)
    ...    runs the mqtt broker and the mapper, and the other container (CONTAINER_2) runs the other tedge components.
    ...    Together the two containers should function similar to installing everything in one container (more or less).
    ...    This is the building blocks for enabling a single-process container setup where each thin-edge.io component
    ...    is running in its own container.
