<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

Dummy change

thin-edge.io is the first open-source and cloud-agnostic edge framework designed for resource-constrained IoT edge devices.

We have started the project to solve the challenge of IoT device enablement in industrial IoT or more precisely to make the integration of IoT devices with cloud and IoT platforms easy and reliable.

With thin-edge.io we want to provide re-usable and modular components, which are not bound to a specific IoT platform, domain model or vendor. It runs on a wide variety of hardware, from small, embedded Linux (Debian, Yocto, etc) devices with very low RAM footprint to large, multi-core industrial servers (IPC). It comes with multi-language support and aims to provide out-of-the box connectivity, security and device management features on any device its deployed on.
