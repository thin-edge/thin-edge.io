One process to run c8y and smc8y
* Restart order ?
* Beware multi-subscritions in a single process
* Beware of blocking message translation
* Service dependency from sm-c8y to agent
  * restart issue?
* What if a user doesn't want sm? or other operations
  * It would be good to be able to disable an operation if unused.


One process for all the mappers (tedge-mapper c8y az)
* Today we have a single executable but run a process per mapper (tedge-mapper c8y; tedge-mapper az)
