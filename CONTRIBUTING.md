# Pull request and git commit guidance

## Opening PRs and organizing commits

PRs should generally address only 1 issue at a time. If you need to fix two bugs, open two separate PRs. This will keep the scope of your pull requests smaller and allow them to be reviewed and merged more quickly.

When possible, fill out as much detail in the pull request template as is reasonable. Most important is to reference the GitHub issue that you are addressing with the PR.

**NOTE:** GitHub has [a feature](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) that will automatically close issues referenced with a keyword (such as "Fixes") by a PR or commit once the PR/commit is merged. Don't use these keywords. We don't want issues to be automatically closed. We want our testers to independently verify and close them.

## Writing good commit messages

Git commit messages should explain the how and why of your change and be separated into a brief subject line followed by a more detailed body. When in doubt, follow this guide for good commit messages and you can’t go wrong: [https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

## Reviewing, addressing feedback, and merging

Generally, pull requests need two approvals from maintainers to be merged.

When addressing review feedback, it is helpful to the reviewer if additional changes are made in new commits. This allows the reviewer to easily see the delta between what they previously reviewed and the changes you added to address their feedback.

Once a PR has the necessary approvals, it can be merged. Here’s how the merge should be handled:

- If the PR is a single logical commit, the merger should use the “Rebase and merge” option. This keeps the git commit history very clean and simple and eliminates noise from "merge commits."
- If the PR is more than one logical commit, the merger should use the “Create a merge commit” option.
- If the PR consists of more than one commit because the author added commits to address feedback, the commits should be squashed into a single commit (or more than one logical commit, if it is a big feature that needs more commits). This can be achieved by the “Squash and merge” option. If they do this, the merger is responsible for cleaning up the commit message according to the previously stated commit message guidance.
