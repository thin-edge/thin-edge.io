# Enabling systemd watchdog for thin-edge services

## Introduction

The systemd watchdog feature enables systemd to detect when a service is unhealthy or unresponsive and attempt to fix it by restarting that service.
To detect if a service is healthy or not, systemd relies on periodic health notifications from that service at regular intervals.
If the service fails to send that notification within a time threshold, then systemd will assume that service to be unhealthy and restart it.

This document describes how the systemd watchdog mechanism can be enabled for thin-edge services.

## Enabling the `watchdog` feature in `systemd`

Enabling systemd `watchdog` for a `thin-edge.io` service (tedge_agent, tedge_mapper_c8y/az/collectd)
using the `systemd` is a two-step process.

### Step 1: Enable the `watchdog` feature in the `systemd` service file
For example to enable the `watchdog` feature for `tedge-mapper-c8y` service, update systemd service file as shown below.

Add `tedge_watchdog.service` in  `After` under `[Unit]` section.
Add `WatchdogSec=5` under `[Service]` section.

The sample service file after updating looks as below.

```shell
[Unit]
Description=tedge-mapper-c8y converts Thin Edge JSON measurements to Cumulocity JSON format.
After=syslog.target network.target mosquitto.service tedge_watchdog.service

[Service]
User=tedge-mapper
ExecStart=/usr/bin/tedge_mapper c8y
Restart=on-failure
RestartPreventExitStatus=255
WatchdogSec=5
```

> Note: The systemd service file for tedge services are usually present
in `/lib/systemd/system` directory, like `/lib/systemd/system/tedge-mapper-c8y.service`.

### Step 2: Start the `tedge-watchdog` service

The `tedge-watchdog` service is responsible for periodically checking the health of
all tedge services for which the watchdog feature is enabled, and send systemd
watchdog notifications on their behalf to systemd.

Start and enable the `tedge-watchdog` service as follows:
	
```shell
systemctl start tedge-watchdog.service
systemctl enable tedge-watchdog.service
``` 

Now, the `tedge-watchdog` service will be keep sending health check messages to the monitored services periodically within their configured `WatchdogSec` interval.

The health check request for service is published to `tedge/health-check/<service-name>` topic and the health status response from that service is expected on `tedge/health/<service-name>` topic.

Once the health status response is received from a particular service, the `tedge-watchdog` service will send the watchdog notification on behalf of that service to systemd.

## Debugging
One can observe the message exchange between the `service` and the `watchdog` by subscribing to `tedge/health/#` and `tedge/health-check/#` topics.

> Note: If the watchdog service did not send the notification to the systemd within `WatchdogSec`, then the systemd will kill the existing service process and restarts it.
