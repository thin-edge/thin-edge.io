# How to configure the local port in mosquitto?

Configuring a mosquitto port in thin edge is a two step process.

## Step 1: Update the port number in mosquitto.conf

The new port number has to be updated in the mosquitto.conf to inform the mosquitto 
daemon to use the new port. Add the below line in the mosquitto.conf file.

```shell
listener [port number]
```   
For example: `listener 1024` means the mosquitto daemon uses port number 1024 to serve the requests.
 
Restart the mosquitto to use the new port number that is configured.

## Step 2: Inform about the new port to mqtt clients

Once the mosquitto daemon is configured to use a specific port. This has to be notified 
to all the mqtt clients that are using mosquitto to publish/subscribe.
Follow below step to do that
   
```shell
tedge config set mqtt.port 1024
```
This will make sure that all the mqtt clients use the newer port that has been set.

## Verify the port configured/set

Use below command to check the port has been set properly or not.
 
```shell
tedge config get mqtt.port
```
This prints out the port that has been set.

## Update to use default port

To use the default port, one has to remove the `listener [port-number]` from the mosquitto.conf manually.
Also has to unset the mqtt.port using the tedge cli framework as below

```shell
tedge config unset mqtt.port
```

## Error case

Below example shows that we can not set string value for the port number.

```shell
tedge config set mqtt.port '"1024"'

Error: failed to set the configuration key: mqtt.port with value: "1234".

Caused by:
    Conversion from String failed
```
