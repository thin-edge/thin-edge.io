# The bridged topics

This document lists the MQTT topics that are supported by the thin-edge.io.

## Thin Edge JSON MQTT Topics
To send the Thin Edge JSON measurements to a supported IoT cloud, the device should publish the measurements on
**tedge/measurements** topic. Internally the tedge-mapper will consume the measurements from this topic, translates and
send them to the cloud that the device has been connected to by the `tedge connect` command.

## Cumulocity MQTT Topics
The topics follow the below format
`<protocol>/<direction><type>[/<template>][/<child id>] `

| Protocol | Direction | Type |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| s = standard  | u = upstream | s =  static (built-in)
| t = transient | d = downstream |c = custom (device-defined)
|               |  e = error| d = default (defined in connect)
|               |           | t = template
|               |           | cr = credentials

## Azure MQTT Topics
MQTT clients on Thin Edge device must use the below topics to communicate with the Azure cloud.
The Azure topics are prefixed by `az/`.

 * `az/messages/events/`  - Use this topic to send the messages from device to cloud.
 The messages are forwarded to the Azure topic named `devices/{device_id}/messages/events/`
 where device_id is the Thin Edge device id.

 * `az/messages/devicebound/#` - Use this topic to subscribe for the messages that were sent from cloud to device.
 Any message published by Azure on one the subtopics of `devices/{device_id}/messages/devicebound/#`
 is republished here.
