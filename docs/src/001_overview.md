# Overview

## Why `thin-edge.io`

An open-source & cloud-agnostic IoT framework designed for resource-constrained Edge devices.

* Simple and secure device connectivity.
* Freedom of cloud platform.
* Freedom of programming language.

## How to start

1) The very first step is to [install `thin-edge.io`](howto-guides/002_installation.md)
and to connect your device to your IoT cloud,
either [Cumulocity IoT](tutorials/connect-c8y.md)
or [Azure IoT](tutorials/connect-azure.md) (10 minutes).
2) You will then be able to [send telemetry data](tutorials/send-thin-edge-data.md) to the cloud
using a [cloud-agnostic message format](architecture/thin-edge-json.md) (5 minutes).
3) The next step is to write your own telemetry component, using your preferred programming language,
say Rust or Python.
