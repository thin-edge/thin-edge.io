# The mapper

Or more appropriately the mappers,
because there is a specific mapper for each cloud provider,
a Cumulocity mapper, an Azure mapper.

The purpose of these mappers is to translate
messages written using the cloud-agnostic [Thin-Edge Json format](thin-edge-json.md),
into cloud-specific messages.
