# Monitor your device with collectd

With thin-edge.io device monitoring, you can collect metrics from your device
and forward these device metrics to IoT platforms in the cloud.

Using these metrics, you can monitor the health of devices
and can proactively initiate actions in case the device seems to malfunction.
Additionally, the metrics can be used to help the customer troubleshoot when problems with the device are reported.

Thin-edge.io uses the open source component [`collectd`](https://collectd.org/) to collect the metrics from the device.
Thin-edge.io translates the collected metrics from their native format to the [thin-edge.io JSON](../architecture/thin-edge-json.md) format
and then into the [cloud-vendor specific format](../architecture/mapper.md).

Enabling monitoring on your device is a 3-steps process:
1. [Install `collectd`](#install-collectd),
2. [Configure `collectd`](#configure-collectd),
3. [Enable thin-edge.io monitoring](#enable-thin-edge-monitoring).

## Install `collectd`

Device monitoring is not enabled by default when you install thin edge.
You will have to install and configure [`collectd`](https://collectd.org/) first.

To install collectd, follow the [collectd installation process](https://collectd.org/download.shtml)
that is specific to your device. On a Debian or Ubuntu linux:

``` shell
sudo apt-get install collectd-core
```

## Configure `collectd`

### TLDR; Just want it running

Thin-edge.io provides a [basic `collectd` configuration](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/blob/main/configuration/contrib/collectd/collectd.conf)
that can be used to collect cpu, memory and disk metrics.

Simply copy that file to the main collectd configuration file and restart the daemon
(it might be good to keep a copy of the original configuration).

``` shell
sudo cp /etc/collectd/collectd.conf /etc/collectd/collectd.conf.backup
sudo cp /etc/tedge/contrib/collectd/collectd.conf /etc/collectd/collectd.conf
sudo systemctl restart collectd
```

### `Collectd.conf`

Unless you opted for the [minimal test configuration provided with thin-edge](#tldr-just-want-it-running),
you will have to update the
[`collectd.conf` configuration file](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml)
(usually located at `/etc/collectd/collectd.conf`)

__Important notes__ You can enable or disable the collectd plugins of your choice, but with some notable exceptions:
1. __MQTT must be enabled__.
   * Thin-edge.io expects the collectd metrics to be published on the local MQTT bus.
     Hence, you must enable the [MQTT write plugin of collectd](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml#plugin_mqtt).
   * The MQTT plugin is available on most distribution of `collectd`, but this is not the case on MacOS using homebrew.
     If you are missing the MQTT plugin, please recompile `collectd` to include the MQTT plugin.
     See [https://github.com/collectd/collectd](https://github.com/collectd/collectd) for details.
   * Here is a config snippet to configure the MQTT write plugin:
     ```
        LoadPlugin mqtt

        <Plugin mqtt>
            <Publish "tedge">
                Host "localhost"
                Port 1883
                ClientId "tedge-collectd"
            </Publish>
        </Plugin>
     ```
2. __RRDTool and CSV might be disabled__
   * The risk with these plugins is to run out of disk space on a small device.
   * With thin-edge.io the metrics collected by `collectd` are forwarded to the cloud,
     hence it makes sense to [disable Local storage](https://github.com/collectd/collectd/issues/2668).
   * For that, simply comment out these two plugins:
    ```
       #LoadPlugin rrdtool
       #LoadPlugin csv
    ```
3. __Cherry-pick the collected metrics__
   * `Collectd` can collect a lot of detailed metrics,
      and it doesn't always make sense to forward all these data to the cloud.
   * Here is a config snippet that uses the `match_regex` plugin to select the metrics of interest,
     filtering out every metric emitted by the memory plugin other than the used metric":
    ```
        PreCacheChain "PreCache"

        LoadPlugin match_regex

        <Chain "PreCache">
            <Rule "memory_free_only">
                <Match "regex">
                    Plugin "memory"
                </Match>
                <Match "regex">
                    TypeInstance "used"
                    Invert true
                </Match>
                Target "stop"
            </Rule>
        </Chain>
    ```

## Enable thin-edge monitoring

To enable monitoring on your device, you have to launch the `tedge-mapper-collectd` daemon process.

``` shell
sudo systemctl enable tedge-mapper-collectd
sudo systemctl start tedge-mapper-collectd
```

This process subscribes to the `collectd/#` topics to read the monitoring metrics published by collectd
and emits the translated measurements in thin-edge.io JSON format to the `tedge/measurements` topic.
You can inspect the collected and translated metrics, by subscribing to these topics:

The metrics collected by `collectd` are emitted to subtopics named after the collectd plugin and the metric name:

```
$ tedge mqtt sub 'collectd/#'

[collectd/raspberrypi/cpu/percent-active] 1623076679.154:0.50125313283208
[collectd/raspberrypi/memory/percent-used] 1623076679.159:1.10760866126707
[collectd/raspberrypi/cpu/percent-active] 1623076680.154:0
[collectd/raspberrypi/df-root/percent_bytes-used] 1623076680.158:71.3109359741211
[collectd/raspberrypi/memory/percent-used] 1623076680.159:1.10760866126707

```

The `tedge-mapper-collectd` translates these collectd measurements into the [thin-edge.io JSON](../architecture/thin-edge-json.md) format,
[grouping the measurements](../references/bridged-topics.md#collectd-topics) emitted by each plugin:

```
tedge mqtt sub 'tedge/measurements'

[tedge/measurements] {"time":"2021-06-07T15:38:59.154895598+01:00","cpu":{"percent-active":0.50251256281407},"memory":{"percent-used":1.11893578135189}}
[tedge/measurements] {"time":"2021-06-07T15:39:00.154967388+01:00","cpu":{"percent-active":0},"df-root":{"percent_bytes-used":71.3110656738281},"memory":{"percent-used":1.12107875001658}}
```

From there, if the device is actually connected to a cloud platform like Cumulocity,
these monitoring metrics will be forwarded to the cloud.

```
tedge mqtt sub 'c8y/#'
[c8y/measurement/measurements/create] {"type": "ThinEdgeMeasurement","time":"2021-06-07T15:40:30.155037451+01:00","cpu":{"percent-active": {"value": 0.753768844221106}},"memory":{"percent-used": {"value": 1.16587699972141}},"df-root":{"percent_bytes-used": {"value": 71.3117904663086}}}
[c8y/measurement/measurements/create] {"type": "ThinEdgeMeasurement","time":"2021-06-07T15:40:31.154898577+01:00","cpu":{"percent-active": {"value": 0.5}},"memory":{"percent-used": {"value": 1.16608109197519}}}
```

If your device is not connected yet see:
* [Connect my device to Cumulocity IoT](./connect-c8y.md)
* [Connect my device to Azure IoT](./connect-azure.md)
