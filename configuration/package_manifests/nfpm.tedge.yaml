  # General note about declared dependencies
  # Ref: https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/issues/2882
  #
  # Don't depend on adduser for any linux packages (deb, rpm or apk)
  # as it is generally included out of the box on such systems.
  # In Yocto distributions, adduser is provided by busy-box, so even if the
  # distribution includes apt-get, the adduser will not appear in the dpkg package list,
  # thus preventing the tedge package from being installed.
  # Even if we wanted to add a dependency for rpm, each RHEL/CentOS
  # variant has another name for the package which provides adduser
  # Don't use dependency as different operating systems:
  # E.g.
  # * shadow-utils (fedora)
  # * shadow (opensuse)

  # Note: Only keep a weak reference to the mosquitto package, so don't install it by default.
  # mosquitto can be installed automatically when installing the tedge-full virtual package
  # This way, it allows the tedge-agent package to be installed directly on child devices
  # without automatically pulling in mosquitto
