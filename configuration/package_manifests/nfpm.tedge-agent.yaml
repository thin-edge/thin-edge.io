# WARNING: Don't use conflicts or breaks as this causes the old packages prerm script to be executed
# which stops the tedge-agent thus causing the OTA to be stuck in EXECUTING.
# One disadvantage is that the tedge_agent package needs to be manually removed after upgrading. The new
# tedge-agent package removes the legacy tedge_agent.prerm script to prevent the new service from being
# stopped as well.
