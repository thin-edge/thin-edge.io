# Coding Guidelines

## Code Style
Follow [Rust coding guidelines](https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md).
When adding new feature or adding an API try to adhere to [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/about.html).
Avoid using unsafe code.

## Code formatting
Always use rustfmt before you commit as your code won't pass CI pipeline if rustfmt is not applied. We adhere to default settings.

```$ cargo fmt```


## Code analysis
Clippy is used to catch common mistakes and we run it as part of our CI pipeline.

```$ cargo clippy```


## Code testing 
Ideally, all code should be unit tested. Unit tests should be in module file or if the file or tests are very long in separate file `tests.rs` in the same directory as `mod.rs`.

## Error handling 
Error handling suggestions follow the [Rust book guidance](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-00-error-handling.html). Recoverable errors should be handled with [Result](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/). Our suggestions on unrecoverable errors are listed below:
* Panic (the code should not panic)
* `unwrap()` - Unwrap should only be used for mutexes (e.g. `lock().unwrap()`) and test code. For all other use cases, prefer `expect()`. The only exception is if the error message is custom-generated, in which case use `.unwrap_or_else(|| panic!("error: {}", foo))`
* `expect()` - Expect should be invoked when a system invariant is expected to be preserved. `expect()` is preferred over `unwrap()` and should contain a detailed error message on failure in most cases.
* `assert!()` - This macro is kept in both debug/release and should be used to protect invariants of the system as necessary.
