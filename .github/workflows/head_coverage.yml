# Upload code coverage report every time there is a push to the main branch.
#
# Codecov guides suggest uploading coverage for push and pull_request events.
# pull-request-checks.yml only runs on PRs though, and when coverage upload only
# happens there, it has an effect of codecov patch reports not picking up the
# latest HEAD and displaying coverage changes that have already been made in
# previous PRs. To fix this, we upload report every time we push to main, which
# also happens when a PR gets merged.
